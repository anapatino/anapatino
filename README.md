### Hi, I'm Ana ðŸ‘‹
________________________________________________________________________________
I am a 5th semester student in systems engineering, I am passionate about learning web development independently and collaborating on university projects.
ðŸŒ± I have my most important projects here, some of them are desktop applications, web pages designed and coded by me.

âš¡ My main interest is to specialize as a Frontend developer and make multiplatform applications with web technology, however this does not prevent me from continuing to learn new things away from this branch.
